HTTPS version is also available and the URL gets updated with the tags you searched for, so you can easily bookmark the page.

Along the same lines of speed dating, our phone conversations or "mini dates" are limited to three minutes each. This is enough time for users to meet each other and chat but not too much time in case someone isn't interested or doesn't feel a connection. When the three minutes are up, users are asked if they would like to continue the conversation. If both users say "yes", the connection stays open and they can talk on MiniDat.es for as long as they want. But if someone says "no", the connection is closed and both people go their separate ways. No hurt feelings, no need to "let her down easily" and no awkward, half-hug on your doorstep.

Nationally, there were 124 million ED visits in 2011, of which the CDC estimates 50% could be handled in a primary care setting. With an average charge for each ED encounter approaching $700 vs. the average physician office charge of $150, every patient redirected away from the ED saves the payor $550. This represents a total potential market savings of $34 billion for facilitating correct use of primary care.   Providing people with the tools they need to find appropriate care everywhere saves everyone, hospitals and patients, money and time.  Patients receive a SMS from triage.me post emergency room discharge. By sending a text to triage.me with their problem and current address, we route the person towards the nearest clinic, providing the address and a link to directions (for smartphone users).  Many clinics that work with the underinsured also often have variable hours and locations. We've made it easy for these clinics to update their hours and location via SMS so that we can better route triage.me users to locations.
